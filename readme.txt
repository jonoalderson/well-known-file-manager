Manage all your website's .well-known files in one place - from security policies to domain verification and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add custom .well-known files? =

Currently, the plugin supports a predefined set of .well-known files. Custom file support may be added in future versions.

= How does caching work? =

The plugin implements intelligent caching for optimal performance. The cache is automatically cleared when you update file content or plugin options, ensuring your files are always served with the latest content.

= Is this plugin compatible with my hosting environment? =

The plugin works with any standard WordPress hosting environment. However, some hosts may have restrictions on serving files from non-standard locations. If you encounter issues, please check your hosting provider's documentation.

= What happens to my .well-known files when I deactivate the plugin? =

When deactivated, the .well-known files will no longer be served, but your settings and file contents are preserved. Reactivating the plugin will restore your configuration.

= Can I use this plugin with a caching plugin? =

Yes! The plugin is designed to work with WordPress caching plugins. It automatically purges its own cache when files are updated and is compatible with most popular caching solutions.
